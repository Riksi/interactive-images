<h3>Description of Weatherbury Upper Farm in <em>Far From the Madding Crowd</em></h3>
<div class="passage">
<p>By daylight, the bower of Oak’s new-found mistress, Bathsheba Everdene, presented itself as a hoary building, of the early stage of Classic Renaissance as regards its architecture, and of a proportion which told at a glance that, as is so frequently the case, it had once been the memorial hall upon a small estate around it, now altogether effaced as a distinct property, and merged in the vast tract of a non-resident landlord, which comprised several such modest demesnes. Fluted pilasters, worked from the solid stone, decorated its front, and above the roof the chimneys were panelled or columnar, some coped gables with finials and like features still retaining traces of their Gothic extraction. Soft brown mosses, like faded velveteen, formed cushions upon the stone tiling, and tufts of the houseleek or sengreen sprouted from the eaves of the low surrounding buildings. A gravel walk leading from the door to the road in front was encrusted at the sides with more moss—here it was a silver-green variety, the nut-brown of the gravel being visible to the width of only a foot or two in the centre. This circumstance, and the generally sleepy air of the whole prospect here, together with the animated and contrasting state of the reverse façade, suggested to the imagination that on the adaptation of the building for farming purposes the vital principle of the house had turned round inside its body to face the other way. Reversals of this kind, strange deformities, tremendous paralyses, are often seen to be inflicted by trade upon edifices—either individual or in the aggregate as streets and towns—which were originally planned for pleasure alone.</p>

<h3>Annotated Key</h3>
<div class="key">
<p><strong>1 – Finials on the gables</strong><br>
“coped gables with finials… traces of their Gothic extraction.”  
Finials are small decorative spikes on the peaks of the triangular gable ends; they come from older Gothic design.</p>

<p><strong>2 – Weathered roof tiles</strong><br>
“soft brown mosses… forming cushions upon the stone tiling.”  
Stone tiles weather and gather moss, creating the mottled, softened roof texture Hardy describes.</p>

<p><strong>3 – Chimney stacks</strong><br>
“chimneys… panelled or columnar.”  
A chimney shaft is the tall vertical block that carries smoke; here they are shaped like panels or columns, making them decorative, not just functional.</p>

<p><strong>4 – Pilaster zone</strong><br>
“fluted pilasters, worked from the solid stone.”  
Pilasters are flattened columns attached to a wall; their fluting is the vertical groove pattern, now softened by age.</p>

<p><strong>5 – Projecting central bay (bow)</strong><br>
“the memorial hall upon a small estate.”  
This three-window bay projects outward as a shallow bow shape — a structural swell used to bring light and status to a hall-like centre, hinting at the house’s earlier hall-like status.</p>

<p><strong>6 – Atmosphere of the façade</strong><br>
“sleepy air… moss-encrusted.”  
The façade — the front face of the building — appears shaded, inward-looking and time-softened, matching Hardy’s description.</p>
