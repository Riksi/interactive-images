  <!-- 1: Finials on the gables -->
  <div class="marker" style="left: 40%; top: 24%;"
       data-tip="&quot;some coped gables with finials and like features still retaining traces of their Gothic extraction&quot; Finials are small decorative spikes on the peaks of the triangular gable ends; they come from older Gothic design.">1</div>

  <!-- 2: Weathered roof tiles -->
  <div class="marker" style="left: 45%; top: 32%;"
       data-tip="&quot;Soft brown mosses, like faded velveteen, formed cushions upon the stone tiling&quot; Stone tiles weather and gather moss, creating the mottled, softened roof texture Hardy describes.">2</div>

  <!-- 3: Chimney stacks -->
  <div class="marker" style="left: 57%; top: 28%;"
       data-tip="&quot;the chimneys were panelled or columnar&quot; A chimney shaft is the tall vertical block that carries smoke; here they are shaped like panels or columns, making them decorative, not just functional.">3</div>

  <!-- 4: Pilaster zone -->
  <div class="marker" style="left: 51%; top: 39%;"
       data-tip="&quot;Fluted pilasters, worked from the solid stone, decorated its front&quot; Pilasters are flattened columns attached to a wall; their fluting is the vertical groove pattern, now softened by age.">4</div>

  <!-- 5: Projecting central bay -->
  <div class="marker" style="left: 51%; top: 52%;"
       data-tip="&quot;it had once been the memorial hall upon a small estate around it&quot; This three-window bay projects outward as a shallow bow shape — a structural swell used to bring light and status to a hall-like centre.">5</div>

  <!-- 6: Atmosphere of the façade -->
  <div class="marker" style="left: 51%; top: 69%;"
       data-tip="&quot;the generally sleepy air of the whole prospect here … suggested to the imagination that … the vital principle of the house had turned round inside its body to face the other way.&quot; The façade — the front face of the building — appears shaded, inward-looking and time-softened, matching Hardy’s description.">6</div>
